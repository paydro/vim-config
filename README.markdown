# Paydro's vim configuration file

This is my vim configuration.

The default colorscheme used is a copy of Textmate's idleFingers
theme. I tried to match the color scheme as closely as possible, but
it's not perfect.

## Installation

```sh
git clone git://github.com/paydro/vim-config.git ~/.vim
cd ~/.vim
git submodule update --init
```
