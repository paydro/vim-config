# Paydro's vim configuration file

I use these settings with MacVim.

The default colorscheme used is a copy of Textmate's idleFingers
theme. I tried to match the color scheme as closely as possible, but
it's not perfect.

## Installation

    git clone git://github.com/paydro/vim-config.git ~/.vim
    cp ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc
